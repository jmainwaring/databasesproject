<h1>Main findings</h1>

<p>
  This page explains the main takeaway from our research. We set out to understand if re-assigning polling places has an impact
  on voter turnout, focused on North Carolina in 2016. Please note the following graph:

<h3>Effect on turnout</h3>

<p>
  The chart above shows the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of getting a new polling place on voter turnout at various distance thresholds (in miles). If the point estimate is above 0, this means individuals who were reassigned polling place were <i> more </i> likely to vote, whereas a point estimate below 0 means the opposite. The bars represent 95% confidence intervals - therefore, if the bottom of the confidence interval is still above 0, we are fairly confident that there is a significant effect of having one's polling place reassigned.                 
</p>    

<p>
  As we can see, there appears to be a positive treatment effect - those with new polling place assignments are in fact more likely to vote.

<h4>Significance</h4>

<p>
  The findings were initially surprising. Going into the study, we believed that people whose polling place changed would have <i> lower </i> turnout, since they had the additional mental burden of finding their new polling place. However, particularly for the demographic we needed for our study - older individuals who have not moved in recent years - some research suggests that new polling place assignment mailers can serve as an unofficial reminder to go out and vote, which we know has a positive impact on turnout.
